    question: "How do you value a startup that hasn’t yet generated revenue?",
    answer: `
      To value an early-stage startup without revenue, we use a combination of methods to assess potential value based on available data: 
      
      ● <strong>Market Comparisons</strong>: We start by comparing your startup to similar companies in the same industry and stage that have recently been acquired or funded.
      ● <strong>Key Factors</strong>: We analyze market size, growth potential, and recent funding trends.
      ● <strong>Venture Capital Method</strong>: This method estimates future value based on projected cash flows and planned funding rounds.

      Consider these additional metrics:
      ● <strong>Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC):</strong>
        •This measures the cost of acquiring a new customer.
        •Formula: CAC = Total Customer Acquisition Costs / Number of Customers Acquired
        •Example:If you spend ₹100,000 to acquire 100 new customers, your CAC is ₹1,000.
      ● <strong>Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV):</strong>
        •Represents the total revenue a customer generates over their relationship with your business.
        •Formula: CLTV = Average Revenue per User (ARPU) x Average Customer Lifespan.
        •Example: If your ARPU is ₹500 per month and customers stay for 24 months, CLTV is ₹12,000.
      ● <strong>Market Share:</strong>
        •Indicates your company's portion of the total market compared to competitors.
        •Formula: Market Share = Your Company's Revenue / Total Market Revenue
        •Example: If your revenue is ₹1 million in a ₹10 million market, your market share is 10%.
      ● <strong>Customer Acquisition Rate (CAR):</strong>
        •Reflects the rate at which you acquire new customers.
        •Formula: CAR = Number of New Customers Acquired / Time Period
        •Example: If you acquire 50 new customers in a month, your CAR is 50.
      ● <strong>Average Revenue Per User (ARPU):</strong>
        •Indicates the average revenue generated from each customer.
        •Formula: ARPU = Total Revenue / Number of Customers
        •Example: If you earn ₹50,000 from 100 customers in a month, your ARPU is ₹500.
